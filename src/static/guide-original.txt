Oldschool Runescape
Ironman guide

Old version: https://pastebin.com/0xGyuk5r
This version is mostly copy pasted from the old, with improved quest order and new methods, just in case you're wondering why it looks the exact same at first.





If you want to donate to me for making this guide, here's a link you can use:

This is completely optional, all donations are very much appreciated.





Please read this first bit before starting with the actual guide.


If there's a mistake in this guide somewhere then feel free to tweet me @ozirislol but don't tell me to update this as soon as some new update comes, these take a very long time to make.
Also I rarely reply to questions that can easily be answered by using ctrl+F on this guide OR by googling.

There is no single right way to play this game, everything in this guide is just what I would recommend. If you don't want to follow a step by step guide then feel free to do your own thing. It might still be worth reading this to pick up some ideas on what goals you could go for.


Thank you for reading and enjoy the guide!

Good luck & have fun.

Do Turael slayer with dorg cbow until 37 Range and 18 slayer

	Use Turael, every 10th task should be done with the highest level slayer master you can use.
	Even though we are using Turael, the goal is to get slayer xp so you should always kill monsters with higher hp, for
	example on bird tasks kill terrorbirds. Vannaka has too many bad tasks so I think this is overall better.


Kill tree spirits with fire strike for a mithril axe AND either another mith axe, addy axe or a rune axe, whichever is first
	The 2nd axe is for actual WC training, not worth the time camping for rune one unless u get lucky since u can just
	buy one at 60wc

	You can trap the paladins behind each other same way as the captain from the tourist trap quest.
	For the spider, there are 2 skeletons on the east wall, stand between them and then mage the big one with earth blast.
	Sometimes the little ones attack you but just run a bit north and then back to the same spot, they'll get stuck.


Upgrade the iban staff
Get 50 attack doing more Turael slayer, remember to get every 10th task from Vannaka
	If you get a task from Vannaka that you really can't do without melee protect then go kill sand crabs until 50 attack

Make an amulet of magic
Kill blue dragons with iban's blast for 43 prayer
	We don't have the agility level for shortcut yet so don't bother banking the hides, not worth doing twice as many trips.

	Add 2400 xp to your current prayer xp and calculate how many bones you need, level 43 requires 50339xp and 1 bone is
	288xp with ectofuntus (2.4k pray xp is from ghosts ahoy quest which will be completed before using the bones)

	Regular ironmen can use the wildy altar if you want to, but either way it's only around 85 bones with ecto so do
	whichever method.

Get at least 1 extra dragon bone on top of 43 prayer, required for the Watchtower quest

	Prayer flicking is recommended, but Turael tasks are pretty easy so it's not mandatory
	Train range to 40 first and then start training Attack

Do Shades of morton quest
	IF there's no one else to help you then this quest can be left until later assuming you used the museum lamps on
	herblore earlier.
	Take the book to the apothecary in Varrock for some free herb xp

Get 25 herblore if you don't have yet
Do Heroes' quest

Do Fremennik trials
Do Throne of miscellania
Do Royal Trouble

Put at least 750k gp to kingdom, set it on 10 maples and 5 herbs
	We'll be using kingdom for only 7 days at the start, make sure you go get 100% back every day for maximum yield

Go back to blackjacking for a few hours and put more money to kingdom so that it doesn't drop below 750k
	Remember to wear rogue outfit
	In total you need 525k on top of the 750k to get all you need from kingdom for now


Clean finds at the museum until you've found all 5 of the items you can get for kudos AND the ruby necklace
Do Bone Voyage quest
Set up your first bird houses
	Video by Alkan showing you how to start if you've never done them before: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf02JEqkUcA

I'm not gonna remind you to do a birdhouse run, do them every 50mins
	Don't bother waking up every 50mins to do a run, but while playing you should at least try to be consistent with them.

AFTER your first hunter levels from a birdhouse run, RC should be your lowest skill
Do Tears of guthix quest, do the minigame weekly it's very worth it
	RC should always be your lowest skill when you do this, at least for a very long time


Start The Giant Dwarf quest to unlock Keldagrim
Buy 2 inventories of gold ore from the blast furnace shop
Go Edgeville furnace and make plenty of digsite pendants
Make molten glass and cut gems until 45 crafting. You'll need 45 for maple birdhouse when you get the 44 hunter.
	Make all of the molten glass first and if needed, craft fishbowls until 45
Buy more seeds from Olivia at Draynor for birdhouses if needed
	Later on the farming guild shop is usually better so don't bother spending hours at Olivia, just get like 1-2k for now


Move your house to Pollnivneach so you can do a birdhouse run every 50 mins and quickly get back to blackjacking.
	Entering your POH portal from Pollnivneach portal is a diary task
Get 88 thieving with blackjacking, should get you about 1.4m GP
	Again, LMS can be done instead if you really hate blackjacking
		If u want something to AFK during this grind, i'd heavily recommend ammonite crabs to get 60 attack and then focus
		on either strength with D Scim or range with bone cbow

	If you really like blackjacking then feel free to get higher than 88, the extra money should be used for keeping kingdom
	running for longer, switch to 10herbs and 5maples in that case


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
REMINDER to take out GP from kingdom after the 7th day. This thieving grind could take some people 1 day and for others multiple days so it's up to you to keep track of it. You should have 6.2k maples from kingdom when you stop using it.

There will be another reminder later since I'd assume for most people it doesn't take that long
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



1.4 Various skilling, agility for graceful

Thieve master farmers for a couple of hours just to get some low level seeds to start farming with, mainly harralanders
	Remember rogue outfit
	I recommend thieving in Draynor since the bank is right next to the farmer to grab some food quickly

	There is a anti-bot feature for master farmers where if you have less than 71 farming, you get less herb seeds, however
	according to mod Ash it should only affect ranarr, snaps and torstols. Those seeds aren't important right now so as long
	as you can get other seeds in good amounts, that's all that matters but I don't have an account to test them right
	now. Mod Ash tweet: https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1400868684474765314


Get 100% hosidius favour, should have 300 compost in bank
	at 45% do mess hall until 100%
Buy pinapples for supercompost from charter ships
Put 15 pineapples into each of the compost bins at the allotment patches, remember to close the bin
	Don't do Hosidius patch yet, we'll be doing construction soon which requires house in Rimmington so it's not worth
	switching house to Kourend for 1 compost run and then switching back

Buy ~200 chocolate from the grand tree food shop, don't buy too much since it's faster later from the RFD chest
Make energy pots, should have some harralanders from kingdom if it's been over a day since you did the quest


Camelot tele
Plant barley seeds at the hops patch northwest of Seers, pay the farmer 3 normal compost to look after them

Minigame tele to blast furnace
Do the Giant Dwarf quest
	if you need more rubies or emeralds, the gem stall in keldagrim is usually stocked.

    These next 2 quests have times where you have to wait for stuff to happen, smith iron dart tips while you wait

Forgettable tale of a drunken dwarf quest
    There's an anvil near the bank in keldagrim
    Your barley will be ready when you need it, use it on a range to get the barley malt
		Plant jute seeds after harvesting the barley for a diary task, don't need to compost or protect them
Do not waste the 2 dwarven stout(m) that you get as the reward!


Garden of tranquility quest



Start Enlightened journey quest
	You need 6 willow branches for the falador diary on top of the 12 needed for the quest so get those as well
While waiting for the willow trees to grow, do these steps:

Do Eyes of glouphrie and Tower of life
	Bring a raw chicken and a raw swordfish to kill a Swordchick for Ardy diary after Tower of life
Smith the rest of your iron dart tips, leave 20 bars for quests

Mine Volcanic ash for ultracompost, get like 2k so you don't have to constantly come back to mine more

Do a farm run of limpwurts, harralanders and ultracompost
	Store 15 supercompost in leprechaun for a quest, make the rest into ultras
	Use volcanic ash on the full bin rather than individual buckets of supercompost

	I'm not gonna be mentioning farm runs anymore, just do them whenever.
	Always use ultra compost on herbs, for limps i'd just use normal compost because the seeds are so easy to get.

Do Temple of Ikov quest
	Start fletching iron darts while you run around doing quests
	If you haven't got a yew bow from medium clues that you may have got from skilling, get a yew long from young implings
	in puro-puro, find a spawn point and catch them as they spawn.


Finish Enlightened journey and unlock Varrock and Castle wars balloons
	While unlikely, it's possible that you didn't get yew logs from wintertodt to unlock castle wars, in that case you'll
	just have to run between Varrock east bank and the sawmill instead of doing the method explained just below.

Construction method:
Make 10+ dueling rings
Equip whichever axe you got from tree spirits earlier

Start at Castle wars, cut 65 willow logs and deposit them to the log storage next to the balloon
Balloon to Varrock, cut full inventory of oak logs and turn them into planks at the sawmill
	3-ticking recommended especially if u didn't get a lucky rune axe
	3 Oaks just next to the balloon: https://i.imgur.com/twMOUDE.png
Teleport to Castle wars, repeat until you have 50 construction banked
	You can use minigame tele every 20mins if you want to save a ring charge
	1500 planks not including Wintertodt XP, check xp calculator if you want to get the exact amount

Get 50 construction, un-note with Phials at Rimmington general store
	lvl 22-33, oak dining table in the dining room
	lvl 33-50, oak larder in the kitchen
Move your house to kourend now for farm patch



Start doing daily tree runs from now on with the seeds you get from birdhouses and later farming contracts as well



Do these quests while fletching iron darts:
	Big chompy bird hunt
	Rag and bone man (first part, should have all bones in bank already)
	Family crest, get goldsmith gauntlets after quest is done
	Start Legend's quest (Get vanilla pod for RFD)
	Death plateau
	Troll Stronghold

I'll assume you have fletched all of them now, if you haven't then finish the rest of them during next step underwater.

Go to the small island at fossil island with the bank, where you dive to seaweed patches

While underwater;
Fletch maple shortbows (u) until 55 fletching (Make sure you fletch all of the darts first)
	The goal here is to pick up the seaweed spores that spawn every now and then
		The spores can spawn north of the anchor so make sure you're checking the minimap and not just your item overlay
	Plant seaweed after you get your first 2 spores.
	You will get a weight warning but you can just ignore that, it makes no difference unless you go to the deep water
Fletch all of your maple logs into maple longbows (u)
	Make sure to leave some logs for birdhouses
Cut all of your uncut gems
If u have any molten glass left, blow all of it into unpowered orbs, make 2 lantern lenses as well


Do seaweed farming every time u do birdhouse run from now on, very important!



Buy 2800 gold ore from blast furnace ore shop, 1 inv per world
	Don't use energy pots for this or the actual smithing part, only run with empty inventory
Get 60 smithing, remember to wear goldsmith gauntlets

Go to Edgeville
Craft the gold bars into gold BRACELETS, leave like 30 bars for teleport jewellery if you need to make more
	Reminder to buy rubies from either keldagrim or kourend castle gem stalls if you run out
	The reason we are doing bracelets instead of amulets is the extra 120gp per high alch, which is worth more than 5xp


Mage bank
If you have 60 magic, get mage arena cape while you're here anyway
Buy another 5k nats, get some cosmics too if you need more
	HCIM; if scared, you should still have enough nats to get 63mage with alching, and then you can boost to get into wizard
	guild.


Do agility until full graceful, 50-60 at Canifis, 60+ at Seers
	Alch your gold bracelets and maple bows(u) while doing agility
	Loot kingdom and fletch more longbows to alch if you run out.
		If you're still getting more maples from kingdom then it's not worth doing agility if u run out of alchs, just move
		to the next step and come back to agility few days later.
		Make sure you keep at least 500 logs for birdhouses!
If you want a break from agility, fish 3k raw karambwans. Banking at Zanaris bank is your best option for now

Should get to 70+ mage by the time you're done with agility for now


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kingdom reminder! If u haven't already, take out all gp from the coffers after the 7th day, total 6.2k maples
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Do the Regicide quest
	Pick up a few whiteberries just north of the elf tracker
Do Hand in the sand quest


Do all of the RFD subquests
	If u didn't fish the 3k karambwans during agility for cook xp, u can leave awowogei's quest until later
Buy a bunch of chocolate dust from the chest and make energy pots





1.5 Diaries and finishing RFD

Plant some Toadflax seeds, agility potion is needed soon for a quest
	If you don't have toadflax seed for some reason, you can do brimhaven agility arena and get 2 toadflax from there
Make a mithril grapple

Do these quests for QP and diaries:
A soul's bane
Another slice of H.A.M
Icthlarin's little helper
In search of the Myreque
In aid of the Myreque
Eagles' peak
Enakhra's Lament
Rat catchers
Olaf's quest
Between a rock
Tai bwo wannai trio
Zogre flesh eater
Rum deal (Req 42 slayer, you should be close to it. Get a task from Mazchna for Mory diary if you don't have one)
	For the 47 prayer req, you can use the ancient mace spec to boost
Cabin fever
One small favour
Watchtower quest

Do all easy and medium diaries
	Kourend diaries can be left undone, I dont do them until I have Xerics tally from shamans and staminas for the quests
	Wildy and fremmy mediums require higher slayer, leave those for when you go back to slayer.
	You probably don't have a crystal key for fally medium diary yet so leave that for later as well.
	For Lumby 50 range req I'd recommend ranging at pest control with bone cbow
		If you're not 70cb for intermediate boat then go do slayer now, train attack to 60 then defense until 70cb
		May as well stay until you get 250pts for void bottoms, good mage def. Need 55 range eventually anyway for red
		chins.


Do Slayer until 60 attack
	Buy Dragon scim
	Normally I have recommended to also buy a Dragon battleaxe, but it's really just not needed anymore due to how easy it
	is to get kwuarms and limpwurts nowadays with farming contracts

Do Eadgar's ruse
Do My arm's big adventure
Do Desert Treasure
	If you didn't get magic logs from Wintertodt, go catch nature implings in puro-puro, you should have 58 hunter easily by
	now from birdhouses.

Finish RFD, buy B gloves
	Here's a video of me killing the bosses with stats from following this guide, not too difficult:
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1h-4grhks





2. Goals after Barrows gloves


Get autoweed perk from Tithe farm(if 54farming), herb sack IMO isn't even worth getting nowadays with everything giving more herbs and seeds than you'd ever need.

Start doing farming contracts as soon as you can do medium contracts, very important!! You can use garden pies to get mediums at 62farm, and hards at 82. Pies can be bought from Cooking guild


If you ever need something AFK to do, just go to ammonite crabs with either bone cbow if you want to catch less chins in the future, or melee them to speed up slayer.



Get 61 Crafting:
Equip rune pick, varrock armor 2, camulet, graceful apart from the body
Bring 1200 empty buckets, 60k gp, 6 waterskins and preferably knife and teak log for 3-ticking
Go to the desert quarry and mine sandstone for 1.2k buckets of sand
	Walk from the rocks to the grinder to maintain run energy if you're 3-ticking

Go to rogues' den and burn giant seaweed on the fire, 4 seaweed at a time
Make molten glass at Edgeville furnace
Blow glass lenses, might as well do it underwater again for more seaweed spores


Get 70 mining and do Lunar's diplomacy
	Only 60 mining is needed for now so you can do this in bits if you want to, but i'd recommend 70 for making friends with
	my arm(Req 72mining but u can boost with dwarven stout(m) which u should have in bank) and to complete fremmy
	hard diary very early for the herb patch shortcut.

	In my opinion the best way to do this is to fill the sandstone grinder with 25k buckets worth of sand to have it ready
	for later, bring 8 waterskins, drop them as they empty for inv space and then do a birdhouse run.
	Finish 70 with your favorite mining method




Get a helm of neitiznot
Get a fighter torso from BA
Strength amulet is as good as a glory ammy for melee slayer(sometimes even better) so just use that for now.

Do slayer until 65 attack and 65 str, if you don't have them already
Get a dragon defender
	Train defense to 60 while getting defenders

Prioritize STR training during slayer, I like to go for 65/80/65 melee stats and from there just train each skill 5 levels before switching to the next

Get 58 slayer, make sure you're consistent with all your farming and birdhouses
	Personally I like to do Turael point boosting until around 150 tasks, every 10th task from Konar just to get all the
	good unlocks and blocklist sorted before doing normal slayer, but you can do slayer however you like.

I recommend doing hard clues, they're good gp/h at this point of the account. Train crafting for blue dhide if you get those steps using the superglass make lunar spell.

Prioritize slayer points on;
Superior slayer > Blocklist > Extend your favorite tasks > Slay ring > Slay helm > Garg smasher




At 58 slayer;
Camp Cave horrors for mask

If you have around 65/80/65 melee stats now, do Making friends with my arm quest and make both of the basalt tele portals in your POH. The quest can be done with lower stats, but the boss can be annoying if you're not hitting well.
Do Fremmy hard diary, get 70 agility and make few agility pots to use the shortcut to speed up your herb runs even more, drink the boost before using the teleport to skip the shortcut.

Do dream mentor and imbue your mask

Get crafting level for slayer rings at some point



Keep doing slayer until level 75.
	If you want to boost brews from ToB for Song of the elves you can stop at around 70slay, whenever u have 70herb banked
	You can go for a B ring during a dagannoth task if you want, 70def with full rune is decent for camping Rex

Do Mage arena 2

Get 77 herblore, you should have it banked by now if you've been farming, if you don't then just keep doing more slayer
	You can finish all the quests that give herb xp or lamps, some hard diaries can also be done.

Get 70 agility if you didn't get it for the herb patch shortcut earlier

Cut and bank 2.2k teak logs at fossil island, from the farming patch teaks.
Do Mahogany homes with teak planks for 70 construction
Finish 70 woodcutting with any method

Get 60 range with bone crossbow at pest control if you haven't already got 60

Get 70 smithing
	If you can't afford to do it all with gold, you can buy like 2k coal and 2k iron and make steel platebodies.
	Steel is a bit slower but you profit GP from it so it's still a decent method.
		If you don't care about rushing DS2 and Sote, just go do more slayer until you can afford to do 70 smithing with
		gold only.

Make botanical pies and +4 herblore boost for sara brews


Do Song of the elves
	If you don't have 80 magic yet for blitz, you could go do MTA for B2P, master wand and inf boots.
	Use blood blitz against Seren. If you go in with inventory full of brews and restores, it's basically impossible to fail
	the fight

Hunt 15k red chins at the Prif hunter area
Get range void from PC
Unlock MM2 chinning area and chin to at least 87 range
	At 70 range, if you're 100cb do western hard diary and upgrade to elite void


Do Dragon slayer 2

Start using kingdom again now that you'll be getting constant GP easily, put it on 10 teaks or mahogany, whichever you prefer to use for construction and 5 on herbs


Ending the guide here, you can pretty much do whatever you want from here.

By far the best thing to do next is to camp Corrupted Gauntlet until 2 enhanced weapon seeds to make both of the weapons and 6 armor seeds for full crystal.
