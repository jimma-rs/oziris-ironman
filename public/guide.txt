-{423}AFTER your first hunter levels from a birdhouse run, RC should be your lowest skill

?running for longer, switch to 10herbs and 5maples in that case


?*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
?*REMINDER to take out GP from kingdom after the 7th day. This thieving grind could take some people 1 day and for others multiple days so it's up to you to keep track of it. You should have 6.2k maples from kingdom when you stop using it.
?*There will be another reminder later since I'd assume for most people it doesn't take that long
>*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



!1.4 Various skilling, agility for graceful

-{432}Thieve master farmers for a couple of hours just to get some low level seeds to start farming with, mainly harralanders
?Remember rogue outfit
?I recommend thieving in Draynor since the bank is right next to the farmer to grab some food quickly

?There is a anti-bot feature for master farmers where if you have less than 71 farming, you get less herb seeds, however
?according to mod Ash it should only affect ranarr, snaps and torstols. Those seeds aren't important right now so as long
?as you can get other seeds in good amounts, that's all that matters but I don't have an account to test them right
?now. Mod Ash tweet: https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1400868684474765314

?Use volcanic ash on the full bin rather than individual buckets of supercompost

-{451}Do Temple of Ikov quest
?Start fletching iron darts while you run around doing quests
?If you haven't got a yew bow from medium clues that you may have got from skilling, get a yew long from young implings

-{452}Finish Enlightened journey and unlock Varrock and Castle wars balloons
?While unlikely, it's possible that you didn't get yew logs from wintertodt to unlock castle wars, in that case you'll

-{465}While underwater;
-{466}Fletch maple shortbows (u) until 55 fletching (Make sure you fletch all of the darts first)

#Mage bank
-{475}If you have 60 magic, get mage arena cape while you're here anyway
-{476}Buy another 5k nats, get some cosmics too if you need more
?HCIM; if scared, you should still have enough nats to get 63mage with alching, and then you can boost to get into wizard

?Alch your gold bracelets and maple bows(u) while doing agility
?Loot kingdom and fletch more longbows to alch if you run out.

??to the next step and come back to agility few days later.
??Make sure you keep at least 500 logs for birdhouses!
-{478}If you want a break from agility, fish 3k raw karambwans. Banking at Zanaris bank is your best option for now

?Kourend diaries can be left undone, I dont do them until I have Xerics tally from shamans and staminas for the quests
?Wildy and fremmy mediums require higher slayer, leave those for when you go back to slayer.
?You probably don't have a crystal key for fally medium diary yet so leave that for later as well.
?For Lumby 50 range req I'd recommend ranging at pest control with bone cbow
?If you're not 70cb for intermediate boat then go do slayer now, train attack to 60 then defense until 70cb
?May as well stay until you get 250pts for void bottoms, good mage def. Need 55 range eventually anyway for red chins.


-{504}Do Slayer until 60 attack
?Buy Dragon scim
?Normally I have recommended to also buy a Dragon battleaxe, but it's really just not needed anymore due to how easy it
?is to get kwuarms and limpwurts nowadays with farming contracts

-{506}Do My arm's big adventure
-{507}Do Desert Treasure
?If you didn't get magic logs from Wintertodt, go catch nature implings in puro-puro, you should have 58 hunter easily by

?Here's a video of me killing the bosses with stats from following this guide, not too difficult:
?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv1h-4grhks





!2. Goals after Barrows gloves


-{509}Get autoweed perk from Tithe farm(if 54farming), herb sack IMO isn't even worth getting nowadays with everything giving more herbs and seeds than you'd ever need.

-{510}Start doing farming contracts as soon as you can do medium contracts, very important!! You can use garden pies to get mediums at 62farm, and hards at 82. Pies can be bought from Cooking guild


-{511}If you ever need something AFK to do, just go to ammonite crabs with either bone cbow if you want to catch less chins in the future, or melee them to speed up slayer.



-{512}Get 61 Crafting:
-{513}Equip rune pick, varrock armor 2, camulet, graceful apart from the body
-{514}Bring 1200 empty buckets, 60k gp, 6 waterskins and preferably knife and teak log for 3-ticking

-{516}Go to rogues' den and burn giant seaweed on the fire, 4 seaweed at a time
-{517}Make molten glass at Edgeville furnace
-{518}Blow glass lenses, might as well do it underwater again for more seaweed spores


-{519}Get 70 mining and do Lunar's diplomacy
?Only 60 mining is needed for now so you can do this in bits if you want to, but i'd recommend 70 for making friends with
?my arm(Req 72mining but u can boost with dwarven stout(m) which u should have in bank) and to complete fremmy
?hard diary very early for the herb patch shortcut.

?In my opinion the best way to do this is to fill the sandstone grinder with 25k buckets worth of sand to have it ready
?for later, bring 8 waterskins, drop them as they empty for inv space and then do a birdhouse run.
?Finish 70 with your favorite mining method




-{520}Get a helm of neitiznot
-{521}Get a fighter torso from BA
-{522}Strength amulet is as good as a glory ammy for melee slayer(sometimes even better) so just use that for now.

-{523}Do slayer until 65 attack and 65 str, if you don't have them already
-{524}Get a dragon defender
?Train defense to 60 while getting defenders

-{525}Prioritize STR training during slayer, I like to go for 65/80/65 melee stats and from there just train each skill 5 levels before switching to the next

-{526}Get 58 slayer, make sure you're consistent with all your farming and birdhouses
?Personally I like to do Turael point boosting until around 150 tasks, every 10th task from Konar just to get all the
?good unlocks and blocklist sorted before doing normal slayer, but you can do slayer however you like.

-{527}I recommend doing hard clues, they're good gp/h at this point of the account. Train crafting for blue dhide if you get those steps using the superglass make lunar spell.

-{528}Prioritize slayer points on;
-{529}Superior slayer > Blocklist > Extend your favorite tasks > Slay ring > Slay helm > Garg smasher




-{530}At 58 slayer;
-{531}Camp Cave horrors for mask

-{532}If you have around 65/80/65 melee stats now, do Making friends with my arm quest and make both of the basalt tele portals in your POH. The quest can be done with lower stats, but the boss can be annoying if you're not hitting well.
-{533}Do Fremmy hard diary, get 70 agility and make few agility pots to use the shortcut to speed up your herb runs even more, drink the boost before using the teleport to skip the shortcut.

-{534}Do dream mentor and imbue your mask

-{535}Get crafting level for slayer rings at some point



-{536}Keep doing slayer until level 75.
?If you want to boost brews from ToB for Song of the elves you can stop at around 70slay, whenever u have 70herb banked
?You can go for a B ring during a dagannoth task if you want, 70def with full rune is decent for camping Rex

-{537}Do Mage arena 2

-{538}Get 77 herblore, you should have it banked by now if you've been farming, if you don't then just keep doing more slayer
?You can finish all the quests that give herb xp or lamps, some hard diaries can also be done.

-{539}Get 70 agility if you didn't get it for the herb patch shortcut earlier

-{540}Cut and bank 2.2k teak logs at fossil island, from the farming patch teaks.
-{541}Do Mahogany homes with teak planks for 70 construction
-{542}Finish 70 woodcutting with any method

-{543}Get 60 range with bone crossbow at pest control if you haven't already got 60

-{544}Get 70 smithing
?If you can't afford to do it all with gold, you can buy like 2k coal and 2k iron and make steel platebodies.
?Steel is a bit slower but you profit GP from it so it's still a decent method.
??If you don't care about rushing DS2 and Sote, just go do more slayer until you can afford to do 70 smithing with
??gold only.

-{545}Make botanical pies and +4 herblore boost for sara brews


-{546}Do Song of the elves
?If you don't have 80 magic yet for blitz, you could go do MTA for B2P, master wand and inf boots.
?Use blood blitz against Seren. If you go in with inventory full of brews and restores, it's basically impossible to fail
?the fight

-{547}Hunt 15k red chins at the Prif hunter area
-{548}Get range void from PC
-{549}Unlock MM2 chinning area and chin to at least 87 range
?At 70 range, if you're 100cb do western hard diary and upgrade to elite void


-{550}Do Dragon slayer 2

-{551}Start using kingdom again now that you'll be getting constant GP easily, put it on 10 teaks or mahogany, whichever you prefer to use for construction and 5 on herbs


-{552}Ending the guide here, you can pretty much do whatever you want from here.

-{553}By far the best thing to do next is to camp Corrupted Gauntlet until 2 enhanced weapon seeds to make both of the weapons and 6 armor seeds for full crystal.
